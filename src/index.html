     Alt Text for Enhanced Screen Reader Compatibility
Alt text is crucial for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers. By providing descriptive alternative text for images, you not only make your e-commerce site more navigable for these users but also boost your SEO through improved image search rankings.

2. Keyboard-Friendly Navigation
Ensure that all interactive elements on your website can be navigated using a keyboard. This is essential for users who are unable to utilize a mouse or other pointing devices due to physical disabilities.

3 Optimized Text for Visual Accessibility
Choose fonts that are clear and easy to read, and ensure they contrast well with the background. Small, blurry, or low-contrast text can pose challenges for users with visual impairments.

4. Accessible Online Forms
Online forms should be straightforward and user-friendly. Implement clear labels and provide instructions, ensuring that any errors are clearly explained in simple language, aiding those with cognitive or visual impairments.

5. Video and Audio Content Accessibility
Include captions or transcripts for any multimedia content. This is vital for users who are deaf or hard of hearing, ensuring they have equal access to the information.

6. Consistency in Navigation for Cognitive Accessibility
A consistent and logical layout aids users with cognitive disabilities, making it easier for people to understand and navigate your site.-->
